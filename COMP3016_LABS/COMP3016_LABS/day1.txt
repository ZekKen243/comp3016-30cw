Alright... work clothes check... boots check... lunch check... I should be just ready for work.

You step out your house to commute to work, busy streets and busy areas all around.
You arrive at the port to the site of your boss.

BOSS: "Welcome to your first day, I see you're new here"
      "Don't worry, first few days aren't that bad, I'll get you through the basics"

      "Below is an example profile of a cargo you must assess"

PROFILE
===================
A - BATCH
3m - WIDTH
10m - LENGTH
5m - HEIGHT
250kg - WEIGHT
===================

BOSS: "On each day, there are different restrictions a cargo must fit under in order to be let through"
      "If they don't fit in, don't allow them. If they do, you can let them pass, simple as that."
      "You'll get warning strikes for any wrong passes, get too many and you'll be let go."

      "Good luck out there."

You prepare your clipboard and pen... and look through the containers to be processed today.
